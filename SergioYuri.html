              <h1><b> We are the cleverest boys in this fucking planet and you will be one of ours if you provide us revolutionary ideas<b></h1> 
              <p><i>We are going to teach you the secret of the life...the real sense of the things which occurred in this world more for more than 2000 years.

                Oh,sure, proverbs are always warmly welcome!</i></p>
